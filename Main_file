It seems like you're asking about GitHub!
GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code.
It allows developers to store their code in repositories (repos),
track changes with version control (Git), and collaborate with other developers. 
Some of its key features include:
Repositories: GitHub repositories store your project files and provide tools for collaboration and version control.
Forking: You can create a copy of someone else's repository to modify and work on independently.
Pull Requests: After making changes, you can submit a pull request to propose merging your changes into the original project.
Issues and Discussions: GitHub offers tools to track bugs, plan features, and have discussions with contributors.
Actions: You can set up workflows to automate tasks, such as running tests or deploying code
